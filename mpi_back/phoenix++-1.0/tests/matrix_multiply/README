./matrix_multiply <side of matrix> <size of Row block> [create files]
side of matrix: Specifies the length of the side of the matrix (both matrices are of the same size) (required)
size of Row block: Number of rows that are assigned for each map task (required)
create files: Flag to create the files that hold the input matrices (optional)
(Leave argument blank if files already exist. The files will be used as input to the application. Set flag to 1 to create files for the first time.) 

The files created are 
"matrix_file_A.txt" (input file)
"matrix_file_B.txt" (input file)


End File
