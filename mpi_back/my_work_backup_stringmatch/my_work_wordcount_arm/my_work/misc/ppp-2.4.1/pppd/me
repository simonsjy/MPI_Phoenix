       The  Point-to-Point  Protocol (PPP) provides a method for transmitting
       datagrams over serial point-to-point links.  PPP is composed of  three
       parts:  a  method  for  encapsulating  datagrams over serial links, an
       extensible Link Control Protocol (LCP), and a family of  Network  Con-
       trol  Protocols  (NCP) for establishing and configuring different net-
       work-layer protocols.

       The encapsulation scheme is provided by driver  code  in  the  kernel.
       Pppd  provides  the  basic LCP, authentication support, and an NCP for
       establishing and configuring the Internet Protocol (IP) (called the IP
       Control Protocol, IPCP).

       _<_t_t_y___n_a_m_e_>
              Communicate  over  the  named  device.   The  string "/dev/" is
              prepended if necessary.  If no device name is given, or if  the
              name  of the terminal connected to the standard input is given,
              pppd will use that terminal, and will not fork to put itself in
              the  background.   A  value  for  this option from a privileged
              source cannot be overridden by a non-privileged user.

       _<_s_p_e_e_d_>
              Set the baud rate to <speed> (a decimal  number).   On  systems
              such  as  4.4BSD and NetBSD, any speed can be specified.  Other
              systems (e.g. SunOS) allow only a limited set of speeds.

       aassyynnccmmaapp _<_m_a_p_>
              Set the async character map to <map>.  This map describes which
              control  characters  cannot  be  successfully received over the
              serial line.  Pppd will ask the peer to send  these  characters
              as a 2-byte escape sequence.  The argument is a 32 bit hex num-
              ber with each bit representing a character to  escape.   Bit  0
              (00000001)  represents  the  character  0x00; bit 31 (80000000)
              represents the character 0x1f  or  ^_.   If  multiple  _a_s_y_n_c_m_a_p
              options  are  given,  the  values  are  ORed  together.   If no
              _a_s_y_n_c_m_a_p option is given, no async character map will be  nego-
              tiated  for  the receive direction; the peer should then escape
              _a_l_l control characters.  To escape transmitted characters,  use
              the _e_s_c_a_p_e option.

       aauutthh   Require the peer to authenticate itself before allowing network
              packets to be sent or received.  This option is the default  if
              the system has a default route.  If neither this option nor the
              _n_o_a_u_t_h option is specified, pppd will only allow  the  peer  to
              use  IP  addresses  to which the system does not already have a
              route.

       ccaallll _n_a_m_e
              Read options from the file /etc/ppp/peers/_n_a_m_e.  This file  may
              contain privileged options, such as _n_o_a_u_t_h, even if pppd is not
              being run by root.  The _n_a_m_e string may not  begin  with  /  or
              include  .. as a pathname component.  The format of the options
              file is described below.

       ccoonnnneecctt _s_c_r_i_p_t
              Use the executable or shell command specified by _s_c_r_i_p_t to  set
              up  the  serial  line.   This  script  would  typically use the
              chat(8) program to dial the modem and start the remote ppp ses-
              sion.   A value for this option from a privileged source cannot
              be overridden by a non-privileged user.

       ccrrttssccttss
              Use hardware flow control (i.e. RTS/CTS) to control the flow of
              data   on  the  serial  port.   If  neither  the  _c_r_t_s_c_t_s,  the
              _n_o_c_r_t_s_c_t_s, the _c_d_t_r_c_t_s nor the _n_o_c_d_t_r_c_t_s option is  given,  the
              hardware  flow  control  setting  for  the  serial port is left
              unchanged.  Some serial ports (such as Macintosh serial  ports)
              lack  a  true  RTS  output.  Such serial ports use this mode to
              implement unidirectional flow control.  The  serial  port  will
              suspend  transmission when requested by the modem (via CTS) but
              will be unable to request the modem stop sending  to  the  com-
              puter. This mode retains the ability to use DTR as a modem con-
              trol line.

       ddeeffaauullttrroouuttee
              Add a default route to the system  routing  tables,  using  the
              peer as the gateway, when IPCP negotiation is successfully com-
              pleted.  This entry is removed when the PPP connection is  bro-
              ken.   This  option  is privileged if the _n_o_d_e_f_a_u_l_t_r_o_u_t_e option
              has been specified.

       ddiissccoonnnneecctt _s_c_r_i_p_t
              Run the executable or shell command specified by  _s_c_r_i_p_t  after
              pppd  has terminated the link.  This script could, for example,
              issue commands to the modem to cause it to hang up if  hardware
              modem  control  signals  were  not  available.   The disconnect
              script is not run if the modem has already hung  up.   A  value
              for  this  option from a privileged source cannot be overridden
              by a non-privileged user.

       eessccaappee _x_x_,_y_y_,_._._.
              Specifies that certain characters should be escaped  on  trans-
              mission  (regardless  of  whether  the peer requests them to be
              escaped with its async control character map).  The  characters
              to  be escaped are specified as a list of hex numbers separated
              by commas.  Note that almost any character can be specified for
              the _e_s_c_a_p_e option, unlike the _a_s_y_n_c_m_a_p option which only allows
              control characters to be specified.  The characters  which  may
              not be escaped are those with hex values 0x20 - 0x3f or 0x5e.

       ffiillee _n_a_m_e
              Read  options  from  file _n_a_m_e (the format is described below).
              The file must be readable by the user who has invoked pppd.

       iinniitt _s_c_r_i_p_t
              Run the executable or shell command specified by _s_c_r_i_p_t to ini-
              tialize  the  serial line.  This script would typically use the
              chat(8) program to configure the modem to enable  auto  answer.
              A  value  for  this  option  from a privileged source cannot be
              overridden by a non-privileged user.

       lloocckk   Specifies that pppd should create a UUCP-style  lock  file  for
              the serial device to ensure exclusive access to the device.

       mmrruu _n  Set  the  MRU  [Maximum Receive Unit] value to _n. Pppd will ask
              the peer to send packets of no more than _n bytes.  The  minimum
              MRU  value  is 128.  The default MRU value is 1500.  A value of
              296 is recommended for slow links (40 bytes for TCP/IP header +
              256  bytes  of data).  (Note that for IPv6 MRU must be at least
              1280)

       mmttuu _n  Set the MTU [Maximum Transmit Unit] value  to  _n.   Unless  the
              peer  requests  a  smaller value via MRU negotiation, pppd will
              request that the kernel networking code send data packets of no
              more  than  _n  bytes  through the PPP network interface.  (Note
              that for IPv6 MTU must be at least 1280)

       ppaassssiivvee
              Enables the "passive" option in the  LCP.   With  this  option,
              pppd  will  attempt  to  initiate  a connection; if no reply is
              received from the peer, pppd will then just wait passively  for
              a  valid  LCP  packet  from the peer, instead of exiting, as it
              would without this option.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       _<_l_o_c_a_l___I_P___a_d_d_r_e_s_s_>::_<_r_e_m_o_t_e___I_P___a_d_d_r_e_s_s_>
              Set the local and/or remote interface IP addresses.  Either one
              may  be omitted.  The IP addresses can be specified with a host
              name or in decimal  dot  notation  (e.g.  150.234.56.78).   The
              default  local  address is the (first) IP address of the system
              (unless the _n_o_i_p_d_e_f_a_u_l_t option is given).  The  remote  address
              will  be obtained from the peer if not specified in any option.
              Thus, in simple cases, this option is not required.  If a local
              and/or  remote  IP  address is specified with this option, pppd
              will not accept a different value from the  peer  in  the  IPCP
              negotiation,  unless  the _i_p_c_p_-_a_c_c_e_p_t_-_l_o_c_a_l and/or _i_p_c_p_-_a_c_c_e_p_t_-
              _r_e_m_o_t_e options are given, respectively.

              Set the local and/or remote 64-bit interface identifier. Either
              one  may  be omitted. The identifier must be specified in stan-
              dard ascii notation of IPv6 addresses  (e.g.  ::dead:beef).  If
              the  _i_p_v_6_c_p_-_u_s_e_-_i_p_a_d_d_r option is given, the local identifier is
              the local IPv4 address (see above).  On systems which  supports
              a  unique persistent id, such as EUI-48 derived from the Ether-
              net MAC address, _i_p_v_6_c_p_-_u_s_e_-_p_e_r_s_i_s_t_e_n_t option can  be  used  to
              replace the _i_p_v_6 _<_l_o_c_a_l_>_,_<_r_e_m_o_t_e_> option. Otherwise the identi-
              fier is randomized.

       aaccttiivvee--ffiilltteerr _f_i_l_t_e_r_-_e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n
              Specifies a packet filter to be  applied  to  data  packets  to
              determine  which  packets  are to be regarded as link activity,
              and therefore reset the idle timer, or cause  the  link  to  be
              brought  up  in demand-dialling mode.  This option is useful in
              conjunction with the iiddllee option if  there  are  packets  being
              sent  or received regularly over the link (for example, routing
              information packets) which would  otherwise  prevent  the  link
              from  ever  appearing to be idle.  The _f_i_l_t_e_r_-_e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n syntax
              is as described for tcpdump(1), except  that  qualifiers  which
              are  inappropriate  for  a PPP link, such as eetthheerr and aarrpp, are
              not permitted.   Generally  the  filter  expression  should  be
              enclosed  in single-quotes to prevent whitespace in the expres-
              sion from being interpreted by the shell. This option  is  cur-
              rently  only  available under NetBSD, and then only if both the
              kernel and pppd were compiled with PPP_FILTER defined.

       aallllooww--iipp _a_d_d_r_e_s_s_(_e_s_)
              Allow peers to use the  given  IP  address  or  subnet  without
              authenticating themselves.  The parameter is parsed as for each
              element of the list of allowed  IP  addresses  in  the  secrets
              files (see the AUTHENTICATION section below).

       bbssddccoommpp _n_r_,_n_t
              Request that the peer compress packets that it sends, using the
              BSD-Compress scheme, with a maximum code size of _n_r  bits,  and
              agree  to compress packets sent to the peer with a maximum code
              size of _n_t bits.  If _n_t is not specified, it  defaults  to  the
              value  given  for  _n_r.  Values in the range 9 to 15 may be used
              for _n_r and _n_t; larger values give better compression  but  con-
              sume more kernel memory for compression dictionaries.  Alterna-
              tively, a value of 0 for _n_r or _n_t disables compression  in  the
              corresponding direction.  Use _n_o_b_s_d_c_o_m_p or _b_s_d_c_o_m_p _0 to disable
              BSD-Compress compression entirely.

       ccddttrrccttss
              Use a non-standard hardware flow control (i.e. DTR/CTS) to con-
              trol  the  flow  of  data  on  the serial port.  If neither the
              _c_r_t_s_c_t_s, the _n_o_c_r_t_s_c_t_s, the _c_d_t_r_c_t_s nor the _n_o_c_d_t_r_c_t_s option is
              given, the hardware flow control setting for the serial port is
              left unchanged.  Some serial ports (such  as  Macintosh  serial
              ports)  lack a true RTS output. Such serial ports use this mode
              to implement true bi-directional flow control. The sacrifice is
              that  this  flow  control  mode  does not permit using DTR as a
              modem control line.

       cchhaapp--iinntteerrvvaall _n
              If this option is given, pppd will rechallenge the peer every _n
              seconds.

       cchhaapp--mmaaxx--cchhaalllleennggee _n
              Set  the  maximum  number  of CHAP challenge transmissions to _n
              (default 10).

       cchhaapp--rreessttaarrtt _n
              Set the CHAP restart interval (retransmission timeout for chal-
              lenges) to _n seconds (default 3).

       ccoonnnneecctt--ddeellaayy _n
              Wait  for  up  _n milliseconds after the connect script finishes
              for a valid PPP packet from the peer.  At the end of this time,
              or when a valid PPP packet is received from the peer, pppd will
              commence negotiation by sending  its  first  LCP  packet.   The
              default  value  is  1000  (1  second).   This  wait period only
              applies if the ccoonnnneecctt or ppttyy option is used.

       ddeebbuugg  Enables connection debugging facilities.   If  this  option  is
              given,  pppd  will log the contents of all control packets sent
              or received in a readable form.  The packets are logged through
              syslog  with facility _d_a_e_m_o_n and level _d_e_b_u_g.  This information
              can be directed to a file by setting up /etc/syslog.conf appro-
              priately (see syslog.conf(5)).

       ddeeffaauulltt--aassyynnccmmaapp
              Disable asyncmap negotiation, forcing all control characters to
              be escaped for both the transmit and the receive direction.

       ddeeffaauulltt--mmrruu
              Disable MRU [Maximum  Receive  Unit]  negotiation.   With  this
              option,  pppd  will use the default MRU value of 1500 bytes for
              both the transmit and receive direction.

       ddeeffllaattee _n_r_,_n_t
              Request that the peer compress packets that it sends, using the
              Deflate  scheme, with a maximum window size of _2_*_*_n_r bytes, and
              agree to compress packets sent to the peer with a maximum  win-
              dow  size  of _2_*_*_n_t bytes.  If _n_t is not specified, it defaults
              to the value given for _n_r.  Values in the range 9 to 15 may  be
              used  for  _n_r and _n_t; larger values give better compression but
              consume  more  kernel  memory  for  compression   dictionaries.
              Alternatively,  a  value of 0 for _n_r or _n_t disables compression
              in the corresponding direction.  Use _n_o_d_e_f_l_a_t_e or _d_e_f_l_a_t_e _0  to
              disable  Deflate  compression  entirely.   (Note: pppd requests
              Deflate compression in preference to BSD-Compress if  the  peer
              can do either.)

       ddeemmaanndd Initiate  the  link  only  on demand, i.e. when data traffic is
              present.  With this option, the remote IP address must be spec-
              ified  by  the  user on the command line or in an options file.
              Pppd will initially configure the interface and enable  it  for
              IP  traffic  without  connecting  to the peer.  When traffic is
              available,  pppd  will  connect  to  the   peer   and   perform
              negotiation, authentication, etc.  When this is completed, pppd
              will commence passing data packets (i.e.,  IP  packets)  across
              the link.

              The   _d_e_m_a_n_d  option  implies  the  _p_e_r_s_i_s_t  option.   If  this
              behaviour is not desired, use the _n_o_p_e_r_s_i_s_t  option  after  the
              _d_e_m_a_n_d option.  The _i_d_l_e and _h_o_l_d_o_f_f options are also useful in
              conjuction with the _d_e_m_a_n_d option.

       ddoommaaiinn _d
              Append the domain name _d to the local host name for authentica-
              tion  purposes.  For example, if gethostname() returns the name
              porsche,   but   the   fully   qualified   domain    name    is
              porsche.Quotron.COM,  you  could  specify  _d_o_m_a_i_n  _Q_u_o_t_r_o_n_._C_O_M.
              Pppd would then use the name _p_o_r_s_c_h_e_._Q_u_o_t_r_o_n_._C_O_M for looking up
              secrets in the secrets file, and as the default name to send to
              the peer when authenticating itself to the peer.   This  option
              is privileged.

       ddrryyrruunn With the ddrryyrruunn option, pppd will print out all the option val-
              ues which have been set and then exit, after parsing  the  com-
              mand line and options files and checking the option values, but
              before initiating the link.  The option values  are  logged  at
              level  info,  and  also  printed  to standard output unless the
              device on standard output is the  device  that  pppd  would  be
              using to communicate with the peer.

       dduummpp   With the dduummpp option, pppd will print out all the option values
              which have been set.  This option is  like  the  ddrryyrruunn  option
              except that pppd proceeds as normal rather than exiting.

       eennddppooiinntt _<_e_p_d_i_s_c_>
              Sets  the  endpoint  discriminator sent by the local machine to
              the peer during multilink negotiation to _<_e_p_d_i_s_c_>.  The default
              is  to  use  the MAC address of the first ethernet interface on
              the system, if any, otherwise the IPv4 address corresponding to
              the  hostname,  if  any, provided it is not in the multicast or
              locally-assigned IP address ranges, or the  localhost  address.
              The  endpoint  discriminator  can  be the string nnuullll or of the
              form _t_y_p_e:_v_a_l_u_e, where type is a decimal number or one  of  the
              strings  llooccaall,  IIPP,  MMAACC, mmaaggiicc, or pphhoonnee.  The value is an IP
              address in dotted-decimal notation for the IIPP type, or a string
              of bytes in hexadecimal, separated by periods or colons for the
              other types.  For the MAC type, the value may also be the  name
              of  an  ethernet  or similar network interface.  This option is
              currently only available under Linux.

       hhiiddee--ppaasssswwoorrdd
              When logging the contents of PAP packets,  this  option  causes
              pppd  to exclude the password string from the log.  This is the
              default.

       hhoollddooffff _n
              Specifies how many seconds to  wait  before  re-initiating  the
              link  after  it terminates.  This option only has any effect if
              the _p_e_r_s_i_s_t or _d_e_m_a_n_d option is used.  The  holdoff  period  is
              not applied if the link was terminated because it was idle.

       iiddllee _n Specifies that pppd should disconnect if the link is idle for _n
              seconds.  The link is idle when no data packets (i.e. IP  pack-
              ets)  are being sent or received.  Note: it is not advisable to
              use this option with the  _p_e_r_s_i_s_t  option  without  the  _d_e_m_a_n_d
              option.   If  the  aaccttiivvee--ffiilltteerr  option is given, data packets
              which are rejected by the specified activity filter also  count
              as the link being idle.

       iippccpp--aacccceepptt--llooccaall
              With this option, pppd will accept the peer¡¯s idea of our local
              IP address, even if the local IP address was  specified  in  an
              option.

       iippccpp--aacccceepptt--rreemmoottee
              With  this  option,  pppd  will  accept  the peer¡¯s idea of its
              (remote) IP address, even if the remote IP address  was  speci-
              fied in an option.

       iippccpp--mmaaxx--ccoonnffiigguurree _n
              Set  the maximum number of IPCP configure-request transmissions
              to _n (default 10).

       iippccpp--mmaaxx--ffaaiilluurree _n
              Set the maximum number of IPCP configure-NAKs  returned  before
              starting to send configure-Rejects instead to _n (default 10).

       iippccpp--mmaaxx--tteerrmmiinnaattee _n
              Set  the maximum number of IPCP terminate-request transmissions
              to _n (default 3).

       iippccpp--rreessttaarrtt _n
              Set the IPCP restart interval  (retransmission  timeout)  to  _n
              seconds (default 3).

       iippppaarraamm _s_t_r_i_n_g
              Provides  an  extra parameter to the ip-up and ip-down scripts.
              If this option is given, the _s_t_r_i_n_g supplied is  given  as  the
              6th parameter to those scripts.

       iippvv66ccpp--mmaaxx--ccoonnffiigguurree _n
              Set  the  maximum  number of IPv6CP configure-request transmis-
              sions to _n (default 10).

       iippvv66ccpp--mmaaxx--ffaaiilluurree _n
              Set the maximum number of IPv6CP configure-NAKs returned before
              starting to send configure-Rejects instead to _n (default 10).

       iippvv66ccpp--mmaaxx--tteerrmmiinnaattee _n
              Set  the  maximum  number of IPv6CP terminate-request transmis-
              sions to _n (default 3).

       iippvv66ccpp--rreessttaarrtt _n
              Set the IPv6CP restart interval (retransmission timeout)  to  _n
              seconds (default 3).

       iippxx    Enable  the  IPXCP and IPX protocols.  This option is presently
              only supported under Linux, and only if your  kernel  has  been
              configured to include IPX support.

       iippxx--nneettwwoorrkk _n
              Set the IPX network number in the IPXCP configure request frame
              to _n, a hexadecimal number (without a leading 0x).  There is no
              valid  default.   If  this option is not specified, the network
              number is obtained from the peer.  If the peer  does  not  have
              the network number, the IPX protocol will not be started.

       iippxx--nnooddee _n::_m
              Set  the  IPX  node numbers. The two node numbers are separated
              from each other with a colon character. The first number  _n  is
              the  local  node number. The second number _m is the peer¡¯s node
              number. Each node number is a hexadecimal number,  at  most  10
              digits  long.  The  node  numbers  on  the  ipx-network must be
              unique. There is no valid default. If this option is not speci-
              fied then the node numbers are obtained from the peer.

       iippxx--rroouutteerr--nnaammee _<_s_t_r_i_n_g_>
              Set the name of the router. This is a string and is sent to the
              peer as information data.

       iippxx--rroouuttiinngg _n
              Set the routing protocol to be received by  this  option.  More
              than  one  instance of _i_p_x_-_r_o_u_t_i_n_g may be specified. The ¡¯_n_o_n_e¡¯
              option (0) may be specified as the only instance  of  ipx-rout-
              ing.  The  values  may  be _0 for _N_O_N_E, _2 for _R_I_P_/_S_A_P, and _4 for
              _N_L_S_P.

       iippxxccpp--aacccceepptt--llooccaall
              Accept the peer¡¯s NAK for the node number specified in the ipx-
              node  option. If a node number was specified, and non-zero, the
              default is to insist that the value be  used.  If  you  include
              this option then you will permit the peer to override the entry
              of the node number.

       iippxxccpp--aacccceepptt--nneettwwoorrkk
              Accept the peer¡¯s NAK for the network number specified  in  the
              ipx-network option. If a network number was specified, and non-
              zero, the default is to insist that the value be used.  If  you
              include  this  option then you will permit the peer to override
              the entry of the node number.

       iippxxccpp--aacccceepptt--rreemmoottee
              Use the  peer¡¯s  network  number  specified  in  the  configure
              request  frame. If a node number was specified for the peer and
              this option was not specified, the peer will be forced  to  use
              the value which you have specified.

       iippxxccpp--mmaaxx--ccoonnffiigguurree _n
              Set  the maximum number of IPXCP configure request frames which
              the system will send to _n. The default is 10.

       iippxxccpp--mmaaxx--ffaaiilluurree _n
              Set the maximum number of IPXCP NAK frames which the local sys-
              tem  will send before it rejects the options. The default value
              is 3.

       iippxxccpp--mmaaxx--tteerrmmiinnaattee _n
              Set the maximum nuber of IPXCP terminate request frames  before
              the  local  system  considers that the peer is not listening to
              them. The default value is 3.

       kkddeebbuugg _n
              Enable debugging code in  the  kernel-level  PPP  driver.   The
              argument  values  depend  on the specific kernel driver, but in
              general a value of 1 will enable general kernel debug messages.
              (Note that these messages are usually only useful for debugging
              the kernel driver itself.)  For the Linux 2.2.x kernel  driver,
              the value is a sum of bits: 1 to enable general debug messages,
              2 to request that the contents of received packets be  printed,
              and  4  to  request that the contents of transmitted packets be
              printed.  On most systems, messages printed by the  kernel  are
              logged  by  syslog(1)  to  a  file as directed in the /etc/sys-
              log.conf configuration file.

       kkttuunnee  Enables pppd to alter kernel settings  as  appropriate.   Under
              Linux,    pppd    will   enable   IP   forwarding   (i.e.   set
              /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward to 1) if the _p_r_o_x_y_a_r_p  option  is
              used,  and  will enable the dynamic IP address option (i.e. set
              /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_dynaddr to 1) in demand mode if the local
              address changes.

       llccpp--eecchhoo--ffaaiilluurree _n
              If  this option is given, pppd will presume the peer to be dead
              if _n LCP echo-requests are sent without receiving a  valid  LCP
              echo-reply.   If  this happens, pppd will terminate the connec-
              tion.  Use of this option requires a  non-zero  value  for  the
              _l_c_p_-_e_c_h_o_-_i_n_t_e_r_v_a_l parameter.  This option can be used to enable
              pppd to terminate after the physical connection has been broken
              (e.g.,  the  modem has hung up) in situations where no hardware
              modem control lines are available.

       llccpp--eecchhoo--iinntteerrvvaall _n
              If this option is given, pppd will  send  an  LCP  echo-request
              frame  to  the  peer every _n seconds.  Normally the peer should
              respond to the echo-request by  sending  an  echo-reply.   This
              option  can  be used with the _l_c_p_-_e_c_h_o_-_f_a_i_l_u_r_e option to detect
              that the peer is no longer connected.

       llccpp--mmaaxx--ccoonnffiigguurree _n
              Set the maximum number of LCP  configure-request  transmissions
              to _n (default 10).

       llccpp--mmaaxx--ffaaiilluurree _n
              Set  the  maximum  number of LCP configure-NAKs returned before
              starting to send configure-Rejects instead to _n (default 10).

       llccpp--mmaaxx--tteerrmmiinnaattee _n
              Set the maximum number of LCP  terminate-request  transmissions
              to _n (default 3).

       llccpp--rreessttaarrtt _n
              Set the LCP restart interval (retransmission timeout) to _n sec-
              onds (default 3).

       lliinnkknnaammee _n_a_m_e
              Sets the logical name of the link to _n_a_m_e.  Pppd will create  a
              file  named  pppppp--_n_a_m_e..ppiidd in /var/run (or /etc/ppp on some sys-
              tems) containing its process ID.  This can be useful in  deter-
              mining  which instance of pppd is responsible for the link to a
              given peer system.  This is a privileged option.

       llooccaall  Don¡¯t use the modem control lines.  With this option, pppd will
              ignore  the  state  of  the CD (Carrier Detect) signal from the
              modem and will not change the state of the DTR  (Data  Terminal
              Ready) signal.

       llooggffdd _n
              Send  log  messages  to  file descriptor _n.  Pppd will send log
              messages to at most one file or file  descriptor  (as  well  as
              sending  the  log  messages  to syslog), so this option and the
              llooggffiillee option are mutually exclusive.  The default is for pppd
              to  send log messages to stdout (file descriptor 1), unless the
              serial port is already open on stdout.

       llooggffiillee _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
              Append log messages to the file _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e (as  well  as  sending
              the log messages to syslog).  The file is opened with the priv-
              ileges of the user who invoked pppd, in append mode.

       llooggiinn  Use the system password database for  authenticating  the  peer
              using  PAP,  and record the user in the system wtmp file.  Note
              that the peer must have an entry  in  the  /etc/ppp/pap-secrets
              file  as  well  as  the  system password database to be allowed
              access.

       mmaaxxccoonnnneecctt _n
              Terminate the connection when it has been available for network
              traffic  for  _n seconds (i.e. _n seconds after the first network
              control protocol comes up).

       mmaaxxffaaiill _n
              Terminate after _n consecutive failed  connection  attempts.   A
              value of 0 means no limit.  The default value is 10.

       mmooddeemm  Use the modem control lines.  This option is the default.  With
              this option, pppd will wait for the CD (Carrier Detect)  signal
              from  the  modem  to be asserted when opening the serial device
              (unless a connect script is specified), and it  will  drop  the
              DTR (Data Terminal Ready) signal briefly when the connection is
              terminated and before executing the connect script.  On Ultrix,
              this  option  implies hardware flow control, as for the _c_r_t_s_c_t_s
              option.

       mmpp     Enables the use of PPP multilink; this  is  an  alias  for  the
              ¡®multilink¡¯  option.   This  option is currently only available
              under Linux.

       mmppsshhoorrttsseeqq
              Enables the use of short (12-bit) sequence numbers in multilink
              headers, as opposed to 24-bit sequence numbers.  This option is
              only available under Linux, and only has any effect  if  multi-
              link is enabled (see the multilink option).

       mmrrrruu _n Sets  the Maximum Reconstructed Receive Unit to _n.  The MRRU is
              the maximum size for a received packet on a  multilink  bundle,
              and  is  analogous  to  the MRU for the individual links.  This
              option is currently only available under Linux,  and  only  has
              any  effect if multilink is enabled (see the multilink option).

       mmss--ddnnss _<_a_d_d_r_>
              If pppd is acting as a server for  Microsoft  Windows  clients,
              this  option  allows pppd to supply one or two DNS (Domain Name
              Server) addresses to the clients.  The first instance  of  this
              option  specifies  the primary DNS address; the second instance
              (if given) specifies the secondary DNS address.   (This  option
              was  present in some older versions of pppd under the name ddnnss--
              aaddddrr.)

       mmss--wwiinnss _<_a_d_d_r_>
              If pppd is acting as a server for Microsoft Windows or  "Samba"
              clients,  this  option  allows  pppd  to supply one or two WINS
              (Windows  Internet  Name  Services)  server  addresses  to  the
              clients.   The first instance of this option specifies the pri-
              mary WINS address; the second instance (if given) specifies the
              secondary WINS address.

       mmuullttiilliinnkk
              Enables  the  use  of  the PPP multilink protocol.  If the peer
              also supports multilink, then this link can become  part  of  a
              bundle  between  the local system and the peer.  If there is an
              existing bundle to the peer, pppd will join this link  to  that
              bundle,  otherwise pppd will create a new bundle.  See the MUL-
              TILINK section below.  This option is currently only  available
              under Linux.

       nnaammee _n_a_m_e
              Set the name of the local system for authentication purposes to
              _n_a_m_e.  This is a privileged option.   With  this  option,  pppd
              will use lines in the secrets files which have _n_a_m_e as the sec-
              ond field when looking for a secret to  use  in  authenticating
              the peer.  In addition, unless overridden with the _u_s_e_r option,
              _n_a_m_e will be used as the name to send to the peer when  authen-
              ticating  the  local  system to the peer.  (Note that pppd does
              not append the domain name to _n_a_m_e.)

       nneettmmaasskk _n
              Set the interface netmask to _n, a 32 bit  netmask  in  "decimal
              dot"  notation  (e.g. 255.255.255.0).  If this option is given,
              the value specified is ORed  with  the  default  netmask.   The
              default  netmask  is  chosen  based on the negotiated remote IP
              address; it is the appropriate network mask for  the  class  of
              the  remote  IP  address,  ORed  with  the netmasks for any non
              point-to-point network interfaces in the system  which  are  on
              the  same  network.  (Note: on some platforms, pppd will always
              use 255.255.255.255 for the netmask, if that is the only appro-
              priate value for a point-to-point interface.)

       nnooaaccccoommpp
              Disable  Address/Control  compression  in both directions (send
              and receive).

       nnooaauutthh Do not require the peer to authenticate itself.  This option is
              privileged.

       nnoobbssddccoommpp
              Disables  BSD-Compress  compression;  ppppppdd  will not request or
              agree to compress packets using the BSD-Compress scheme.

       nnooccccpp  Disable CCP (Compression Control Protocol)  negotiation.   This
              option  should  only  be required if the peer is buggy and gets
              confused by requests from pppd for CCP negotiation.

       nnooccrrttssccttss
              Disable hardware flow control  (i.e.  RTS/CTS)  on  the  serial
              port.  If neither the _c_r_t_s_c_t_s nor the _n_o_c_r_t_s_c_t_s nor the _c_d_t_r_c_t_s
              nor the _n_o_c_d_t_r_c_t_s option is given, the  hardware  flow  control
              setting for the serial port is left unchanged.

       nnooccddttrrccttss
              This option is a synonym for _n_o_c_r_t_s_c_t_s. Either of these options
              will disable both forms of hardware flow control.

       nnooddeeffaauullttrroouuttee
              Disable the _d_e_f_a_u_l_t_r_o_u_t_e option.  The system administrator  who
              wishes  to prevent users from creating default routes with pppd
              can do so by placing this option in the /etc/ppp/options  file.

       nnooddeeffllaattee
              Disables Deflate compression; pppd will not request or agree to
              compress packets using the Deflate scheme.

       nnooddeettaacchh
              Don¡¯t detach  from  the  controlling  terminal.   Without  this
              option, if a serial device other than the terminal on the stan-
              dard input is specified, pppd will fork to become a  background
              process.

       nnooeennddppooiinntt
              Disables  pppd  from  sending  an endpoint discriminator to the
              peer or accepting one from the peer (see the MULTILINK  section
              below).   This  option  should  only be required if the peer is
              buggy.

       nnooiipp   Disable IPCP negotiation and  IP  communication.   This  option
              should  only be required if the peer is buggy and gets confused
              by requests from pppd for IPCP negotiation.

       nnooiippvv66 Disable IPv6CP negotiation and IPv6 communication. This  option
              should  only be required if the peer is buggy and gets confused
              by requests from pppd for IPv6CP negotiation.

       nnooiippddeeffaauulltt
              Disables the default behaviour when  no  local  IP  address  is
              specified,  which  is  to  determine (if possible) the local IP
              address from the hostname.  With this  option,  the  peer  will
              have  to  supply  the  local IP address during IPCP negotiation
              (unless it specified explicitly on the command line  or  in  an
              options file).

       nnooiippxx  Disable  the  IPXCP and IPX protocols.  This option should only
              be required if the peer is buggy and gets confused by  requests
              from pppd for IPXCP negotiation.

       nnookkttuunnee
              Opposite  of the _k_t_u_n_e option; disables pppd from changing sys-
              tem settings.

       nnoolloogg  Do not send log messages to a file or  file  descriptor.   This
              option cancels the llooggffdd and llooggffiillee options.

       nnoommaaggiicc
              Disable  magic number negotiation.  With this option, pppd can-
              not detect a looped-back line.   This  option  should  only  be
              needed if the peer is buggy.

       nnoommpp   Disables  the  use  of PPP multilink.  This option is currently
              only available under Linux.

       nnoommppsshhoorrttsseeqq
              Disables the use of short (12-bit) sequence numbers in the  PPP
              multilink protocol, forcing the use of 24-bit sequence numbers.
              This option is currently only available under Linux,  and  only
              has any effect if multilink is enabled.

       nnoommuullttiilliinnkk
              Disables  the  use  of PPP multilink.  This option is currently
              only available under Linux.

       nnooppccoommpp
              Disable protocol field  compression  negotiation  in  both  the
              receive and the transmit direction.

       nnooppeerrssiisstt
              Exit  once  a connection has been made and terminated.  This is
              the default unless the _p_e_r_s_i_s_t or _d_e_m_a_n_d option has been speci-
              fied.

       nnoopprreeddiiccttoorr11
              Do not accept or agree to Predictor-1 compression.

       nnoopprrooxxyyaarrpp
              Disable  the  _p_r_o_x_y_a_r_p  option.   The  system administrator who
              wishes to prevent users from creating proxy  ARP  entries  with
              pppd  can  do so by placing this option in the /etc/ppp/options
              file.

       nnoottttyy  Normally, pppd requires a terminal device.  With  this  option,
              pppd  will  allocate  itself a pseudo-tty master/slave pair and
              use the slave as its terminal device.  Pppd will create a child
              process  to  act  as a ¡®character shunt¡¯ to transfer characters
              between the pseudo-tty master and its standard input  and  out-
              put.  Thus pppd will transmit characters on its standard output
              and receive characters on its standard input even if  they  are
              not  terminal  devices.   This option increases the latency and
              CPU overhead of transferring data over the ppp interface as all
              of the characters sent and received must flow through the char-
              acter shunt process.  An explicit device name may not be  given
              if this option is used.

       nnoovvjj   Disable  Van  Jacobson  style TCP/IP header compression in both
              the transmit and the receive direction.

       nnoovvjjccccoommpp
              Disable the connection-ID compression option  in  Van  Jacobson
              style  TCP/IP  header compression.  With this option, pppd will
              not omit the connection-ID byte from  Van  Jacobson  compressed
              TCP/IP headers, nor ask the peer to do so.

       ppaappccrryypptt
              Indicates  that  all  secrets  in the /etc/ppp/pap-secrets file
              which are used for  checking  the  identity  of  the  peer  are
              encrypted,  and  thus  pppd should not accept a password which,
              before  encryption,  is  identical  to  the  secret  from   the
              /etc/ppp/pap-secrets file.

       ppaapp--mmaaxx--aauutthhrreeqq _n
              Set  the  maximum  number of PAP authenticate-request transmis-
              sions to _n (default 10).

       ppaapp--rreessttaarrtt _n
              Set the PAP restart interval (retransmission timeout) to _n sec-
              onds (default 3).

       ppaapp--ttiimmeeoouutt _n
              Set  the  maximum  time  that  pppd  will  wait for the peer to
              authenticate itself with PAP to _n seconds (0 means no limit).

       ppaassss--ffiilltteerr _f_i_l_t_e_r_-_e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n
              Specifies a packet filter to applied to data packets being sent
              or  received  to  determine  which packets should be allowed to
              pass.  Packets which are rejected by the  filter  are  silently
              discarded.  This option can be used to prevent specific network
              daemons (such as routed) using up link bandwidth, or to provide
              a  basic  firewall capability.  The _f_i_l_t_e_r_-_e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n syntax is
              as described for tcpdump(1), except that qualifiers  which  are
              inappropriate  for  a  PPP link, such as eetthheerr and aarrpp, are not
              permitted.  Generally the filter expression should be  enclosed
              in  single-quotes  to prevent whitespace in the expression from
              being interpreted by the shell.  Note that it  is  possible  to
              apply  different  constraints  to incoming and outgoing packets
              using the iinnbboouunndd and oouuttbboouunndd qualifiers. This option is  cur-
              rently  only  available under NetBSD, and then only if both the
              kernel and pppd were compiled with PPP_FILTER defined.

       ppeerrssiisstt
              Do not exit after a connection is terminated;  instead  try  to
              reopen the connection.

       pplluuggiinn _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
              Load the shared library object file _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e as a plugin.  This
              is a privileged option.

       pprreeddiiccttoorr11
              Request that the peer compress frames that it sends using  Pre-
              dictor-1  compression, and agree to compress transmitted frames
              with Predictor-1 if  requested.   This  option  has  no  effect
              unless the kernel driver supports Predictor-1 compression.

       pprriivvggrroouupp _g_r_o_u_p_-_n_a_m_e
              Allows  members  of group _g_r_o_u_p_-_n_a_m_e to use privileged options.
              This is a privileged option.  Use of this option requires  care
              as  there is no guarantee that members of _g_r_o_u_p_-_n_a_m_e cannot use
              pppd to become root  themselves.   Consider  it  equivalent  to
              putting the members of _g_r_o_u_p_-_n_a_m_e in the kmem or disk group.

       pprrooxxyyaarrpp
              Add an entry to this system¡¯s ARP [Address Resolution Protocol]
              table with the IP address of the peer and the Ethernet  address
              of  this  system.  This will have the effect of making the peer
              appear to other systems to be on the local ethernet.

       ppttyy _s_c_r_i_p_t
              Specifies that the command _s_c_r_i_p_t is to be used to  communicate
              rather  than  a  specific  terminal device.  Pppd will allocate
              itself a pseudo-tty master/slave pair and use the slave as  its
              terminal  device.   The  _s_c_r_i_p_t  will be run in a child process
              with the pseudo-tty master as its standard  input  and  output.
              An  explicit  device  name  may  not be given if this option is
              used.  (Note: if the _r_e_c_o_r_d option is used in  conjuction  with
              the  _p_t_y option, the child process will have pipes on its stan-
              dard input and output.)

       rreecceeiivvee--aallll
              With this option, pppd will accept all control characters  from
              the  peer,  including  those  marked  in  the receive asyncmap.
              Without this option, pppd  will  discard  those  characters  as
              specified in RFC1662.  This option should only be needed if the
              peer is buggy.

       rreeccoorrdd _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
              Specifies that pppd  should  record  all  characters  sent  and
              received  to  a  file  named  _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e.  This file is opened in
              append mode, using the user¡¯s user-ID  and  permissions.   This
              option  is  implemented  using  a  pseudo-tty  and a process to
              transfer characters between the pseudo-tty and the real  serial
              device,  so  it  will  increase the latency and CPU overhead of
              transferring data over the ppp interface.  The  characters  are
              stored  in  a  tagged format with timestamps, which can be dis-

              When  logging  the  contents of PAP packets, this option causes
              pppd to show the password string in the log message.

       ssiilleenntt With this option, pppd will not transmit LCP packets to  initi-

       Options can be taken from files as well as  the  command  line.   Pppd
       reads   options   from   the   files  /etc/ppp/options,  ~/.ppprc  and
       /etc/ppp/options._t_t_y_n_a_m_e (in that order) before processing the options
       on  the  command line.  (In fact, the command-line options are scanned
       to find the terminal name before the options._t_t_y_n_a_m_e  file  is  read.)
       In  forming the name of the options._t_t_y_n_a_m_e file, the initial /dev/ is
       removed from the terminal name, and any  remaining  /  characters  are
       replaced with dots.

       An options file is parsed into a series of words, delimited by whites-
       pace.  Whitespace can be included in a word by enclosing the  word  in
       double-quotes (").  A backslash (\) quotes the following character.  A
       hash (#) starts a comment, which continues until the end of the  line.
       There  is  no  restriction on using the _f_i_l_e or _c_a_l_l options within an
       options file.

SSEECCUURRIITTYY
       _p_p_p_d provides system administrators  with  sufficient  access  control
       that  PPP  access  to  a  server machine can be provided to legitimate
       users without fear of compromising the security of the server  or  the
       network  it¡¯s  on.   This  control is provided through restrictions on
       which IP addresses the peer may use, based on its authenticated  iden-
       tity  (if any), and through restrictions on which options a non-privi-
       leged user may use.  Several of pppd¡¯s options are privileged, in par-
       ticular  those which permit potentially insecure configurations; these
       options are only accepted in files which are under the control of  the
       system administrator, or if pppd is being run by root.

       The  default  behaviour of pppd is to allow an unauthenticated peer to
       use a given IP address only if the system  does  not  already  have  a
       route to that IP address.  For example, a system with a permanent con-
       nection to the wider internet will normally have a default route,  and
       thus all peers will have to authenticate themselves in order to set up
       a connection.  On such a system, the _a_u_t_h option is the  default.   On
       the  other hand, a system where the PPP link is the only connection to
       the internet will not normally have a default route, so the peer  will
       be able to use almost any IP address without authenticating itself.

       As  indicated  above,  some security-sensitive options are privileged,
       which means that they may not be used by  an  ordinary  non-privileged
       user  running  a  setuid-root pppd, either on the command line, in the
       user¡¯s ~/.ppprc file, or in  an  options  file  read  using  the  _f_i_l_e
       option.  Privileged options may be used in /etc/ppp/options file or in
       an options file read using the _c_a_l_l option.  If pppd is being  run  by
       the root user, privileged options can be used without restriction.

       When  opening the device, pppd uses either the invoking user¡¯s user ID
       or the root UID (that is, 0), depending on whether the device name was
       specified by the user or the system administrator.  If the device name
       comes from a  privileged  source,  that  is,  /etc/ppp/options  or  an
       options  file  read  using the _c_a_l_l option, pppd uses full root privi-
       leges when opening the device.  Thus, by creating an appropriate  file
       under  /etc/ppp/peers,  the  system  administrator  can allow users to
       establish a ppp connection via a device which they would not  normally
       have  permission  to  access.  Otherwise pppd uses the invoking user¡¯s
       real UID when opening the device.

AAUUTTHHEENNTTIICCAATTIIOONN
       Authentication is the process whereby one peer convinces the other  of
       its  identity.   This  involves the first peer sending its name to the
       other, together with some kind of secret information which could  only
       come  from  the  genuine  authorized  user  of  that name.  In such an
       exchange, we will call the first peer the "client" and the  other  the
       "server".   The client has a name by which it identifies itself to the
       server, and the server also has a name by which it  identifies  itself
       to  the  client.   Generally the genuine client shares some secret (or
       password) with the server, and authenticates itself by proving that it
       knows that secret.  Very often, the names used for authentication cor-
       respond to the internet hostnames of the peers, but this is not essen-
       tial.

       At  present,  pppd supports two authentication protocols: the Password
       Authentication Protocol (PAP) and the Challenge Handshake  Authentica-
       tion  Protocol (CHAP).  PAP involves the client sending its name and a
       cleartext password to the server to authenticate itself.  In contrast,
       the  server  initiates  the  CHAP authentication exchange by sending a
       challenge to the client (the challenge packet  includes  the  server¡¯s
       name).   The  client  must  respond with a response which includes its
       name plus a hash value derived from the shared secret  and  the  chal-
       lenge, in order to prove that it knows the secret.

       The  PPP protocol, being symmetrical, allows both peers to require the
       other to authenticate itself.  In that case, two separate and indepen-
       dent authentication exchanges will occur.  The two exchanges could use
       different authentication protocols, and in principle, different  names
       could be used in the two exchanges.

       The  default  behaviour  of  pppd  is  to  agree  to  authenticate  if
       requested, and to not require authentication from the peer.   However,
       pppd  will not agree to authenticate itself with a particular protocol
       if it has no secrets which could be used to do so.

       Pppd stores  secrets  for  use  in  authentication  in  secrets  files
       (/etc/ppp/pap-secrets  for PAP, /etc/ppp/chap-secrets for CHAP).  Both
       secrets files have the same format.  The  secrets  files  can  contain
       secrets  for pppd to use in authenticating itself to other systems, as
       well as secrets for pppd to use when authenticating other  systems  to
       itself.

       Each  line  in  a secrets file contains one secret.  A given secret is
       specific to a particular combination of client and  server  -  it  can
       only  be  used  by  that client to authenticate itself to that server.
       Thus each line in a secrets file has at least 3 fields:  the  name  of
       the  client, the name of the server, and the secret.  These fields may
       be followed by a list of the IP addresses that  the  specified  client
       may use when connecting to the specified server.

       A  secrets  file  is  parsed  into words as for a options file, so the
       client name, server name and secrets fields must  each  be  one  word,
       with  any  embedded  spaces  or  other  special  characters  quoted or
       escaped.  Note that case is significant in the client and server names
       and in the secret.

       If  the  secret  starts with an ¡®@¡¯, what follows is assumed to be the
       name of a file from which to read the secret.  A "*" as the client  or
       server name matches any name.  When selecting a secret, pppd takes the
       best match, i.e.  the match with the fewest wildcards.

       Any following words on the same line are taken to be a list of accept-
       able  IP  addresses for that client.  If there are only 3 words on the
       line, or if the first word is "-", then all IP  addresses  are  disal-
       lowed.   To  allow  any  address,  use  "*".  A word starting with "!"
       indicates that the specified address is _n_o_t  acceptable.   An  address
       may  be  followed  by  "/" and a number _n, to indicate a whole subnet,
       i.e. all addresses which have the same value in the most significant _n
       bits.   In this form, the address may be followed by a plus sign ("+")
       to indicate that one address from the subnet is authorized,  based  on
       the  ppp network interface unit number in use.  In this case, the host
       part of the address will be set to the unit number plus one.

       Thus a secrets file contains both secrets for  use  in  authenticating
       other hosts, plus secrets which we use for authenticating ourselves to
       others.  When pppd is authenticating the  peer  (checking  the  peer¡¯s
       identity), it chooses a secret with the peer¡¯s name in the first field
       and the name of the local system in the second field.  The name of the
       local  system  defaults to the hostname, with the domain name appended
       if the _d_o_m_a_i_n option is used.  This default can be overridden with the
       _n_a_m_e option, except when the _u_s_e_h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e option is used.

       When  pppd is choosing a secret to use in authenticating itself to the
       peer, it first determines what name it is going  to  use  to  identify
       itself  to  the peer.  This name can be specified by the user with the
       _u_s_e_r option.  If this option is not used, the  name  defaults  to  the
       name  of  the  local  system,  determined as described in the previous
       paragraph.  Then pppd looks for a secret with this name in  the  first
       field  and  the  peer¡¯s  name in the second field.  Pppd will know the
       name of the peer if CHAP authentication is  being  used,  because  the
       peer  will  have  sent it in the challenge packet.  However, if PAP is
       being used, pppd will have to  determine  the  peer¡¯s  name  from  the
       options  specified  by the user.  The user can specify the peer¡¯s name
       directly with the _r_e_m_o_t_e_n_a_m_e option.   Otherwise,  if  the  remote  IP
       address  was  specified  by a name (rather than in numeric form), that
       name will be used as the peer¡¯s name.  Failing that, pppd will use the
       null string as the peer¡¯s name.

       When  authenticating the peer with PAP, the supplied password is first
       compared with the secret from  the  secrets  file.   If  the  password
       doesn¡¯t  match the secret, the password is encrypted using crypt() and
       checked against the secret again.  Thus secrets for authenticating the
       peer  can  be  stored  in  encrypted form if desired.  If the _p_a_p_c_r_y_p_t
       option is given, the first (unencrypted) comparison  is  omitted,  for
       better security.

       Furthermore, if the _l_o_g_i_n option was specified, the username and pass-
       word are also checked against the system password database.  Thus, the
       system  administrator  can  set  up  the pap-secrets file to allow PPP
       access only to certain users, and to restrict the set of IP  addresses
       that  each  user can use.  Typically, when using the _l_o_g_i_n option, the
       secret in /etc/ppp/pap-secrets would be "", which will match any pass-
       word  supplied  by  the  peer.   This avoids the need to have the same
       secret in two places.

       Authentication must be satisfactorily completed before  IPCP  (or  any
       other  Network  Control  Protocol)  can  be  started.   If the peer is
       required to authenticate itself, and fails to do so, pppd will  termi-
       nated  the  link (by closing LCP).  If IPCP negotiates an unacceptable
       IP address for the remote host, IPCP will be closed.  IP  packets  can
       only be sent or received when IPCP is open.

       In  some cases it is desirable to allow some hosts which can¡¯t authen-
       ticate themselves to connect and use one of a  restricted  set  of  IP
       addresses, even when the local host generally requires authentication.
       If the peer refuses to authenticate itself when requested, pppd  takes
       that  as  equivalent to authenticating with PAP using the empty string
       for the username and password.  Thus, by adding a  line  to  the  pap-
       secrets file which specifies the empty string for the client and pass-
       word, it is possible to allow restricted access to hosts which  refuse
       to authenticate themselves.

RROOUUTTIINNGG
       When  IPCP negotiation is completed successfully, pppd will inform the
       kernel of the local and remote IP addresses  for  the  ppp  interface.
       This  is  sufficient  to  create a host route to the remote end of the
       link, which will enable the peers to exchange IP packets.   Communica-
       tion  with  other  machines generally requires further modification to
       routing tables and/or ARP (Address Resolution  Protocol)  tables.   In
       most cases the _d_e_f_a_u_l_t_r_o_u_t_e and/or _p_r_o_x_y_a_r_p options are sufficient for
       this, but  in  some  cases  further  intervention  is  required.   The
       /etc/ppp/ip-up script can be used for this.

       Sometimes  it  is  desirable to add a default route through the remote
       host, as in the case of a machine whose only connection to the  Inter-
       net is through the ppp interface.  The _d_e_f_a_u_l_t_r_o_u_t_e option causes pppd
       to create such a default route when IPCP comes up, and delete it  when
       the link is terminated.

       In  some  cases  it  is  desirable  to use proxy ARP, for example on a
       server machine connected to a LAN, in order to allow  other  hosts  to
       communicate  with the remote host.  The _p_r_o_x_y_a_r_p option causes pppd to
       look for a network interface on the same subnet as the remote host (an
       interface  supporting  broadcast and ARP, which is up and not a point-
       to-point or loopback interface).  If found, pppd creates a  permanent,
       published  ARP  entry  with  the IP address of the remote host and the
       hardware address of the network interface found.

       When the _d_e_m_a_n_d option  is  used,  the  interface  IP  addresses  have
       already  been  set  at  the point when IPCP comes up.  If pppd has not
       been able to negotiate the same addresses that it  used  to  configure
       the  interface  (for example when the peer is an ISP that uses dynamic
       IP address assignment), pppd has to change the interface IP  addresses
       to  the  negotiated addresses.  This may disrupt existing connections,
       and the use of demand dialling with peers that do dynamic  IP  address
       assignment is not recommended.

MMUULLTTIILLIINNKK
       Multilink PPP provides the capability to combine two or more PPP links
       between a pair of machines into a single ¡®bundle¡¯, which appears as  a
       single  virtual PPP link which has the combined bandwidth of the indi-
       vidual links.  Currently, multilink PPP is only supported under Linux.

       Pppd  detects that the link it is controlling is connected to the same
       peer as another link using the peer¡¯s endpoint discriminator  and  the
       authenticated  identity of the peer (if it authenticates itself).  The
       endpoint discriminator is a block of data which  is  hopefully  unique
       for  each peer.  Several types of data can be used, including locally-
       assigned strings of  bytes,  IP  addresses,  MAC  addresses,  randomly
       strings  of bytes, or E-164 phone numbers.  The endpoint discriminator
       sent to the peer by pppd can be set using the endpoint option.

       In circumstances the peer may send no endpoint discriminator or a non-
       unique  value.   The optional bundle option adds an extra string which
       is added to the peer¡¯s endpoint discriminator and authenticated  iden-
       tity  when  matching  up links to be joined together in a bundle.  The
       bundle option can also be used to allow the establishment of  multiple
       bundles  between  the  local  system  and  the  peer.  Pppd uses a TDB
       database in /var/run/pppd.tdb to match up links.

       Assuming that multilink is enabled and the peer is willing to  negoti-
       ate multilink, then when pppd is invoked to bring up the first link to
       the peer, it will detect that no other link is connected to  the  peer
       and  create a new bundle, that is, another ppp network interface unit.
       When another pppd is invoked to bring up another link to the peer,  it
       will  detect  the existing bundle and join its link to it.  Currently,
       if the first pppd terminates (for example, because of a  hangup  or  a
       received signal) the bundle is destroyed.

EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
       The  following examples assume that the /etc/ppp/options file contains
       the _a_u_t_h option (as in the default /etc/ppp/options file  in  the  ppp
       distribution).

       Probably  the  most common use of pppd is to dial out to an ISP.  This
       can be done with a command such as

              pppd call isp

       where the /etc/ppp/peers/isp file is set up by the system  administra-
       tor to contain something like this:

              ttyS0 19200 crtscts
              connect ¡¯/usr/sbin/chat -v -f /etc/ppp/chat-isp¡¯
              noauth

       In  this  example,  we  are  using chat to dial the ISP¡¯s modem and go
       through any logon sequence required.  The /etc/ppp/chat-isp file  con-
       tains  the script used by chat; it could for example contain something
       like this:

              ABORT "NO CARRIER"
              ABORT "NO DIALTONE"
              ABORT "ERROR"
              ABORT "NO ANSWER"
              ABORT "BUSY"

       Pppd can also be used to provide a dial-in ppp service for users.   If
       the  users already have login accounts, the simplest way to set up the
       ppp service is to let the users log in to their accounts and run  pppd
       (installed setuid-root) with a command such as

              pppd proxyarp

       To  allow a user to use the PPP facilities, you need to allocate an IP
       address for that user¡¯s machine and create an entry  in  /etc/ppp/pap-
       secrets  or  /etc/ppp/chap-secrets  (depending on which authentication
       method the PPP implementation on the user¡¯s machine supports), so that
       the user¡¯s machine can authenticate itself.  For example, if Joe has a
       machine called "joespc" which is to be  allowed  to  dial  in  to  the
       machine  called  "server"  and  use  the IP address joespc.my.net, you
       would add an entry like this to /etc/ppp/pap-secrets or /etc/ppp/chap-
       secrets:

              joespc    server    "joe¡¯s secret" joespc.my.net

       Alternatively,  you  can create a username called (for example) "ppp",
       whose login shell is  pppd  and  whose  home  directory  is  /etc/ppp.
       Options  to  be  used  when  pppd  is  run  this  way  can  be  put in
       /etc/ppp/.ppprc.

       If your serial connection is any more  complicated  than  a  piece  of
       wire,  you  may  need  to  arrange  for  some control characters to be
       escaped.  In particular, it is often useful to  escape  XON  (^Q)  and
       XOFF  (^S),  using _a_s_y_n_c_m_a_p _a_0_0_0_0.  If the path includes a telnet, you
       probably should escape ^] as well (_a_s_y_n_c_m_a_p _2_0_0_a_0_0_0_0).   If  the  path
       includes  an  rlogin, you will need to use the _e_s_c_a_p_e _f_f option on the
       end which is running the rlogin client, since many rlogin  implementa-
       tions  are not transparent; they will remove the sequence [0xff, 0xff,
       0x73, 0x73, followed by any 8 bytes] from the stream.

       Messages are sent to the  syslog  daemon  using  facility  LOG_DAEMON.
       (This  can  be  overriden  by  recompiling pppd with the macro LOG_PPP
       defined as the desired facility.)  In order to see the error and debug
       messages,  you  will need to edit your /etc/syslog.conf file to direct
       the messages to the desired output device or file.

       The _d_e_b_u_g option causes the contents of all control  packets  sent  or
       received  to  be  logged, that is, all LCP, PAP, CHAP or IPCP packets.
       This can be useful if the PPP  negotiation  does  not  succeed  or  if
       authentication  fails.   If  debugging is enabled at compile time, the
       _d_e_b_u_g option also causes other debugging messages to be logged.

       Debugging can also be enabled or disabled by sending a SIGUSR1  signal
       to the pppd process.  This signal acts as a toggle.

       The  exit  status  of  pppd  is  set to indicate whether any error was
       detected, or the reason for the link  being  terminated.   The  values
       used are:

       00      Pppd has detached, or otherwise the connection was successfully
              established and terminated at the peer¡¯s request.

       11      An immediately fatal error of some kind occurred,  such  as  an
              essential  system  call failing, or running out of virtual mem-
              ory.

       22      An error was detected in processing the options given, such  as
              two mutually exclusive options being used.

       33      Pppd is not setuid-root and the invoking user is not root.

       44      The  kernel  does  not support PPP, for example, the PPP kernel
              driver is not included or cannot be loaded.

       55      Pppd terminated because it was sent a SIGINT, SIGTERM or SIGHUP
              signal.

       66      The serial port could not be locked.

       77      The serial port could not be opened.

       99      The  command  specified as the argument to the _p_t_y option could
              not be run.

       1100     The PPP negotiation failed, that is, it didn¡¯t reach the  point
              where at least one network protocol (e.g. IP) was running.

       1111     The peer system failed (or refused) to authenticate itself.

       1122     The link was established successfully and terminated because it
              was idle.

       1133     The link was established successfully  and  terminated  because
              the connect time limit was reached.

       1144     Callback  was  negotiated  and  an  incoming call should arrive
              shortly.

       1155     The link was terminated because the peer is not  responding  to
              echo requests.

       1166     The link was terminated by the modem hanging up.

       1177     The   PPP   negotiation  failed  because  serial  loopback  was
              detected.

       1188     The init script failed (returned a non-zero exit status).

       Pppd invokes scripts at various stages in its processing which can  be
       used to perform site-specific ancillary processing.  These scripts are
       usually shell scripts, but could be  executable  code  files  instead.
       Pppd  does  not  wait for the scripts to finish.  The scripts are exe-
       cuted as root (with the real and effective user-id set to 0), so  that
       they  can  do  things  such as update routing tables or run privileged
       daemons.  Be careful that the contents of these scripts do not compro-
       mise  your  system¡¯s  security.   Pppd  runs the scripts with standard
       input, output and error redirected to /dev/null, and with an  environ-
       ment  that  is  empty  except for some environment variables that give
       information about the link.  The environment variables that pppd  sets
       are:

       DDEEVVIICCEE The name of the serial tty device being used.

       IIFFNNAAMMEE The name of the network interface being used.

       IIPPLLOOCCAALL
              The IP address for the local end of the link.  This is only set
              when IPCP has come up.

       IIPPRREEMMOOTTEE
              The IP address for the remote end of the link.   This  is  only
              set when IPCP has come up.

       PPEEEERRNNAAMMEE
              The  authenticated  name  of the peer.  This is only set if the
              peer authenticates itself.

       SSPPEEEEDD  The baud rate of the tty device.

       OORRIIGG__UUIIDD
              The real user-id of the user who invoked pppd.

       PPPPPPLLOOGGNNAAMMEE
              The username of the real user-id that  invoked  pppd.  This  is
              always set.

       For  the  ip-down  and auth-down scripts, pppd also sets the following
       variables giving statistics for the connection:

       CCOONNNNEECCTT__TTIIMMEE
              The number of seconds from when  the  PPP  negotiation  started
              until the connection was terminated.

       BBYYTTEESS__SSEENNTT
              The number of bytes sent (at the level of the serial port) dur-
              ing the connection.

       BBYYTTEESS__RRCCVVDD
              The number of bytes received (at the level of the serial  port)
              during the connection.

       LLIINNKKNNAAMMEE
              The logical name of the link, set with the _l_i_n_k_n_a_m_e option.

       Pppd invokes the following scripts, if they exist.  It is not an error
       if they don¡¯t exist.

       //eettcc//pppppp//aauutthh--uupp
              A program or script which is executed after the  remote  system
              successfully  authenticates  itself.   It  is executed with the
              parameters

              _i_n_t_e_r_f_a_c_e_-_n_a_m_e _p_e_e_r_-_n_a_m_e _u_s_e_r_-_n_a_m_e _t_t_y_-_d_e_v_i_c_e _s_p_e_e_d

              Note that this script is  not  executed  if  the  peer  doesn¡¯t
              authenticate  itself,  for  example  when  the _n_o_a_u_t_h option is
              used.

       //eettcc//pppppp//aauutthh--ddoowwnn
              A program or script which is executed when the link goes  down,
              if /etc/ppp/auth-up was previously executed.  It is executed in
              the same manner with the same parameters as /etc/ppp/auth-up.

       //eettcc//pppppp//iipp--uupp

       The following signals have the specified effect when sent to pppd.

       SSIIGGIINNTT,, SSIIGGTTEERRMM
              These signals cause pppd to  terminate  the  link  (by  closing
              LCP), restore the serial device settings, and exit.

       SSIIGGHHUUPP This  signal  causes  pppd  to  terminate the link, restore the
              serial device settings, and close the serial  device.   If  the
              _p_e_r_s_i_s_t  or  _d_e_m_a_n_d option has been specified, pppd will try to
              reopen the serial device and start  another  connection  (after
              the holdoff period).  Otherwise pppd will exit.  If this signal
              is received during the holdoff period, it causes  pppd  to  end
              the holdoff period immediately.

       SSIIGGUUSSRR11
              This signal toggles the state of the _d_e_b_u_g option.

       SSIIGGUUSSRR22
              This  signal  causes pppd to renegotiate compression.  This can
              be useful to re-enable compression after it has  been  disabled
              as  a result of a fatal decompression error.  (Fatal decompres-
              sion errors generally indicate a bug in one or other  implemen-
              tation.)
