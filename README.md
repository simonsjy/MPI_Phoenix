key words:MNPI+Phoenix;parallel programming;multi-core distributed system

This program is designed by myself for the Undergraduate course graduation design

I designed a lightweight framework for distributed computing MPI+Phoenix , which mainly usedin embedded
cluster environment. The framework mainly considering the heterogeneity between nodes in the design process. 
and the framework of parallel image processing applications.
MPI and Phoenix are both existing parallel programming model,and combine them together to work well on Heterogeneous 
multi-core distributed system.And I test this model with one PC and 8 BeagleBoard ,and it worked well.
